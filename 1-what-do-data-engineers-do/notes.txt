 Lesson 1 – Enabling Data Analytics

 Step 1: Understand the Data Landscape First
Before discussing goals, I would begin by understanding:
- What data is currently collected?
- Where is it stored? (databases, files, cloud storage)
- In what formats? (CSV, JSON, SQL tables, logs)
- How often is it updated?

This helps assess technical readiness and define boundaries for analytics.

 Step 2: Identify Data Gaps
After reviewing the data sources, I would ask:
- Do we have all the data needed for analysis?
- Are there any key missing fields or systems?
- Is the data reliable, complete, and consistent?

Understanding what is missing is as important as knowing what is available.

 Step 3: Clarify Business Goals
With the data context in mind, I would meet with stakeholders and ask:
- What are the most important business questions we need to answer?
- Are we focused on performance, forecasting, customer behavior, or operations?
- What KPIs are already tracked? Which ones are needed?

 Step 4: Build ETL to Align with Business Goals
Once goals and data availability are clear, I would:
- Extract relevant raw data from source systems.
- Transform it to match business logic and reporting requirements.
- Load it into a structured form (e.g., data warehouse, dashboard-ready tables).

This ensures that the analytics system is both technically feasible and business-driven.

 Conclusion
My approach is data-first but goal-aligned: validate the available inputs, understand the expected outputs, and then build a clean, maintainable data pipeline to bridge the two.

My interest in data engineering started when I wanted to better understand the philosophy of Data Lifecycle Management — how data is collected, used, stored, and cleaned up over time.
